  # DigiFi TaskBots
  DigiFi's TaskBots Module for its Loan Origination System

  Unlike other modules in the DigiFi Loan Origination System, taskbots are generally run on a separate server from the main application. Currently, the best option for using taskbots locally is to run the application locally on a separate port from the core DigiFi Loan Origination System.
